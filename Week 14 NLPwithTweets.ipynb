Her persisting gentleness &amp; the world’s betrayal of it. https://t.co/2o1z8Hrht6 Filled with rage and grief, and so broken by the murders in Uvalde. By Buffalo, Laguna Woods and so many others.

I feel so lucky to have gotten to watch you all these years, but this week was a lesson in emotional intelligence and resilience. We all learned from you. Thank you. https://t.co/VQxyeEf0mJ It’s august 🥰 To say thank you for all you have done to make this album what it was, I wanted to give you the original version of The Lakes. Happy 1 year anniversary to Rebekah, Betty, Inez, James, Augustine and the stories we all created around them. Happy Anniversary, folklore. 🌿 It’s been 1 year since we escaped the real world together and imagined ourselves someplace simpler. With tall trees &amp; salt air. Where you can wear lace nightgowns that make you look like a Victorian ghost &amp; no one will side eye you cause no one is around https://t.co/4Gfmh9hXDs https://t.co/MmsujVaV83 You wouldn’t be the first renegade to need somebody 🌹 \\n\\nCollage by Graham Tolbert\\nPhoto by James Reynolds https://t.co/nVcvyiubyX When @Aaron_Dessner came into my life, I was ushered into his world of free-flowing creativity where you don’t overthink, you just make music. A song we wrote for his project @BRMadjv (which also features ⚡️Justin Vernon✨) is out! It’s called Renegade. https://t.co/qisY2CQ0bJ https://t.co/PzTMNyskDS Happy Father’s Day to all the dads but mostly mine, who called me yesterday to remind me he still has guitar picks from the Red Tour, ‘if they’re needed’. The next album that I’ll be releasing is my version of Red, which will be out on November 19. This will be the first time you hear all 30 songs that were meant to go on Red. And hey, one of them is even ten minutes long🧣 https://t.co/FOBLS5aHpS https://t.co/6zWa64Owgp I LOVE YOU MOM https://t.co/hmLe8ZRTjm This one hit me hard.

Thank you 🙏 💗 You All Over Me is produced by Aaron Dessner and co-written by Scooter Carusoe - can’t wait for you to hear it 💛 One thing I’ve been loving about these From The Vault songs is that they’ve never been heard, so I can experiment, play, and even include some of my favorite artists. I’m really excited to have @MarenMorris singing background vocals on this song!! ☔️ HI. I wanted to let you know that the first “From the Vault” song I’m releasing from Fearless (Taylor’s Version) comes out tomorrow at midnight eastern.
